# Helpshift Web Chat Integration Examples

## Purpose

This repository contains the integration of Web Chat using different frameworks. The goal is to provide you sample integrations to help you adhere to best practices while integrating Web Chat into your website or web app.

## Frameworks Covered

This repository includes sample applications built with the following frameworks:
+ React
+ Next.js
+ Angular
+ Vue.js

## Repository structure

This repository is organised into separate directories for each framework. Each directory contains the respective sample application and its associated files.

## Navigating the repository

To explore the sample applications, navigate to the respective directory of the framework you are interested in:

Each directory contains its own `README.md` file with specific instructions on how to run the sample app locally.

## Exploring the codebase

In our codebase, we use `@NOTE` to highlight the important comments and explanations. These `@NOTE` comments provide additional context and information related to the code. You can find them throughout the codebase of each sample app to understand the logic and functionality.

Before running any app you have to provide the PLATFROM_ID and DOMAIN to load Web Chat manually. For more information you can follow this [link](https://developers.helpshift.com/web-chat/getting-started/#prerequisites):
